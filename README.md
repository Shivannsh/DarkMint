## üß† Technical Concepts

### Modified Merkle Patricia Trie (MPT)

- Used for verifying Ethereum account proofs
- Ethereum‚Äôs data structure for storing account and state information, enabling efficient and secure proofs
- Implements both final layer (account) and intermediate layer verification
- Ensures state root consistency with Ethereum blockchain

### Cryptographic Functions

- **Poseidon Hash**: Primary hash function, optimized for ZK-SNARKs
- **Keccak-256**: Used for Ethereum address generation and verification
- **RLP Encoding**: Ethereum's recursive length prefix encoding for account and state data

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs

- Built on SP1 zkVM for efficient SNARK generation
- Proves account existence and balance correctness
- Maintains transaction privacy while ensuring validity

## üß© Modified Merkle Patricia Trie Proof Verifier

DarkMint's core privacy and proof system is built on three Rank-1 Constraint System (R1CS) circuits, which together enable efficient and private verification of Ethereum state using a modified Merkle Patricia Trie (MPT). These circuits are:

### 1. MPT-Middle Circuit (merkle_proof.rs)

This circuit verifies the relationship between two consecutive layers in the MPT proof:

- **Layer Commitment:** For a layer $l_i$, we compute a SNARK-friendly commitment $h(l_i \mid s)$, where $h$ is a hash function (e.g., Poseidon) and $s$ is a random salt. The salt ensures that the commitment is hiding, so the verifier cannot guess the layer contents.
- **Keccak Substring Constraint:** The circuit enforces that $keccak(l_i)$ (the Ethereum-compatible hash of $l_i$) appears as a substring within the previous layer $l_{i-1}$.
- **Previous Layer Commitment:** The previous layer $l_{i-1}$ is also committed as $h(l_{i-1} \mid s)$.



This ensures the integrity of the path from the account leaf up to the root in the MPT.

### 2. MPT-Last Circuit (account_verification.rs)

This circuit verifies the final (leaf) layer of the MPT, which contains the Ethereum account:

- **Account Existence:** Proves that there exists an account within the final layer $l_{last}$, with commitment $h(l_{last} \mid s)$.
- **Public Key Constraint:** The account's public key is the poseidon hash of some preimage $p$:
  - $pk = poseidon(p, p)$
- **Nullifier Generation:** The nullifier is computed as $poseidon(p, 0)$, which is used to prevent double-spending in privacy protocols.



This circuit ties the cryptographic identity (public key and nullifier) to the committed account data in the MPT.

### 3. Nullifier and Account Logic

- **Nullifier:** $nullifier = poseidon(p, 0)$
- **Public Key:** $pk = poseidon(p, p)$
- **Purpose:** The nullifier is a unique value derived from the secret preimage $p$, ensuring that each spend can be detected (to prevent double-spending) without revealing $p$ itself.

## Wallet Management

- Securely derives burn addresses, manages encrypted/unencrypted coins, and persists wallet state

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

1. Install Rust and required tools:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup default stable
```

2. Install SP1:

```bash
curl -L https://docs.succinct.xyz/install | bash
```

3. Clone and build the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shivannsh/darkmint
cd darkmint/program
cargo build --release
```

4. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd script
cargo build --release
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Setting up Environment

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
RPC_URL=
PRIVATE_KEY=
SP1_PRIVATE_KEY=
API_KEY=
```

### Basic Commands

Navigate to the script directory and run:

1. **Burn Private Coins**:
The burn command is used to burn a specific amount of ETH from the provided private key and creates a burn address that proves the burnt amount

```bash
cargo run -- --burn --amount AMOUNT --priv-src $PRIVATE_KEY --provider-url $RPC_URL
```

2. **Generate Proof to Mint Private Coins**:
The mint command is used to mint the ETH amount related to a burnt address. to mint the total burnt amount run the mint command without --encrypted, but to mint the burnt amount partially add the --encrypted tag
````bash
 NETWORK_PRIVATE_KEY=$SP1_PRIVATE_KEY cargo run --release -- --prove --dst-addr $RECEIVING_WALLER_ADDRESS --src-burn-addr $BURN_ADDRESS_DERVIED --priv-src $PRIVATE_KEY --provider-SP1_PROVER=networkurl $RPC_URL
````

3. **Generate Verification Key**:

```bash
cargo run --release --bin vkey
```

### Output

- Proofs and public inputs are written to `proof.json` in script directory

### Future Scope 

- This code can be natively integrated into the wallets and the process can eased out 
- This code Can also used as a foundation for Dark Pools and Dark Pools can easily  be created on top of it
